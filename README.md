# xm122level
Acconeer XM122 Fluid Level Metering

I use this thing to measure the level of a water body next to my house and publish the results to Home Assistant.

Results are published to MQTT, the code works with Home-Assistant MQTT auto-discovery. 
This is neither modular nor does it support all XM122 services and detectors but perhaps it's a useful starting point.
