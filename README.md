# xm122level
Acconeer XM122 Fluid Level Metering

I use this thing to measure the level of a water body next to my house and publish the results to MQTT

Results are published to MQTT.
This is neither modular nor does it support all XM122 services and detectors but perhaps it's a useful starting point.
